# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

> _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.  
>   
> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

- When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
- Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- 2 - 4 decisions.
- Ordered from most to least important.
- Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
- Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1.  One process-related decision that turned out to be successful was our weekly meetings on Friday. These meetings allowed us to review what each member did the previous week and assign tasks for what each member had to do the coming week.

2.  Another process-related decision that turned out to be successful was using Asana to manage tasks. This allowed all the members to see the status of tasks so that people don't end up doing the same thing by mistake.

3.  Using Slack as our primary communication channel was a good decision as Slack makes several auxiliary tasks easier. With Slack we can easily create and keep track of communication channels that each serve a specific purpose.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

- 2 - 4 decisions.
- Ordered from most to least important.
- Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
- Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1.  We spent too much time on the UI design.

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- Ordered from most to least important.
- Explain why you are making a change.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

- How did you prepare your demo?
- What did you manage to demo to your partner?
- Did your partner accept the features?
- Were there change requests?
- What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
- _This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed_
